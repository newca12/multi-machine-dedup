# multi-machine-dedup

## About ##

multi-machine-dedup is a deduplication tool using SQLite to allow multi-machine features.

multi-machine-dedup is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

## How to use it ##

Index a directory
```
 cargo run -- index -l LABEL --db SQLITE_FILE DIRECTORY_FULL_PATH
```

Check a directory
```
 cargo run -- check-integrity -l LABEL --db SQLITE_FILE
```

## Example of SQL queries ##

You can use a convenient database tool like [DBeaver CE](https://dbeaver.io/) to query the generated SQLite database.

Find top duplicates files larger than A_SIZE
```
select *, count(*) as nb_dup from file where size > A_SIZE group by hash order by nb_dup DESC, size DESC ;
```

Find all files with the same CRC_VALUE
```
select * from file where hash='A_CRC_VALUE' ;
```

Find all files with image/jpeg MIME-type.
```
select * from hash where mime like "image/jpeg" ;
```

## Roadmap ##

Inspired by https://github.com/hgrecco/dedup multi-machine-dedup will probably propose similar features.
